\section*{Acknowledgement}
The author would like to graciously acknowledge the continued investment of time and effort on the part of Dr. Sarvesh Kulkarni, Villanova University, in the author's education throughout the course of the last six years, culminating in this course. He has provided invaluable knowledge in a range of subject areas, always with the same attention to detail, passion, and genuine interest in the success of his students. 

The author would also like to dedicate this work to Dr. Richard Perry, Villanova University, for his similar commitment and enthusiasm. He would also like to thank Dr. Perry for having a name that is much easier to approximate in an acronym, for facilitating the humorous naming of this algorithm. 

Finally, the author would like to acknowledge David Randazzo, whose own submission for this assignment, the ``CRAP'' protocol, served to inspire the author to come up with an acronym that was at least slightly funnier (hopefully). It is the hope of the author that this injection of humor is appreciated, and he wishes to make it known that, despite the humor, he did impart his best effort in realizing a robust and thoughtful solution to the task at hand.
