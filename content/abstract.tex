\section*{Abstract}
Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) require the implementation of non-conventional routing protocols to accommodate their nature as a infrastructure-less networks that function using peer-based multi-hop routing. These networks have been deployed with increasing frequency in recent years for a variety of use cases, including disaster response. This paper proposes a routing algorithm, RIC-PERRI, which seeks to address the unique needs of routing in such a critical response scenario, where highly reliable communications links are essential and node disconnections could have life or death consequences. The algorithm addresses these needs by precomputing redundant routes for all nodes in a system, as well as enabling proactive notifications for any detected instances of node failure. The algorithm is derived from the ubiquitous Distance Vector routing protocol, and takes strides where possible to ensure compatibility with the packet formats and conventions utilized by it and many similar protocols to ease implementation and adoption.
