	abstract = {An ad hoc network is a collection of mobile nodes forming an instant network without fixed topology. In such a network, each node acts as both router and host simultaneously, and can move out or join in the network freely. The instantly created network does not have any base infrastructures as used in the conventional networks, but it is compatible with the conventional networks. DSDV is a modification of the conventional Bellman-Ford routing algorithm. It addresses the drawbacks related to the poor looping properties of RIP in the face of broken links. The modification adapted in DSDV makes it a more suitable routing protocol for ad hoc networks. This paper reviews the DSDV protocol, and analyzes the properties of DSDV when it is used for ad hoc networks routing.},

	abstract = {An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of a collection of Mobile Hosts without the required intervention of any centralized Access Point. In this paper we present an innovative design for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. The basic idea of the design is to operate each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other Mobile Hosts within the network. This amounts to a new sort of routing protocol. We have investigated modifications to the basic Bellman-Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP [5], to make it suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network mechanism as is required by users wishing to utilize ad hoc networks. Our modifications address some of the previous objections to the use of Bellman-Ford, related to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the face of broken links and the resulting time dependent nature of the interconnection topology describing the links between the Mobile Hosts. Finally, we describe the ways in which the basic network-layer routing can be modified to provide MAC-layer support for ad-hoc networks.},
